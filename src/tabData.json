The Rock Bottom Remainders were the brainchild of Kathi Kamen Goldmark, a book publicist and musician from San Francisco.  The group included Dave Barry on lead guitar, Ridley Pearson on bass, Barbara Kingslover on keyboards, Robert Fulghum on mandolin, and me on rhythm guitar.  There was a trio of \"chick singers,\" <em>a la</em> the Dixie Cups, made up (usually) of Kathi, Tad Bartimus, and Amy Tan.",
